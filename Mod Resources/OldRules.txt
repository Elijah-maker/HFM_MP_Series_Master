Vicky 2: Standard Rules
================
1. Claimed countries (from the spreadsheet) are reserved unless the player doesnt give warning they cant play
2. 1 GP ally before 1850, no more than 2 until 1890, 3 post 1890, and no limits once Great Wars are discovered. (Vision alliances are allowed but must be announced.)
3. Great powers are not allowed to subsidize their factories. The only exception are factories directly involved in military production, however, those must not produce an amount of military goods greater than three times (3x) the maximum capacity of your military. 
-- This can be found my maximizing your military budget and looking at your trade tab. 
4. Spherelings only allowed GP ally is overlord, unless sphered by war
5. Playing China is restricted
-- Cannot have Chinese cores as states aside from Manchuria, Taiwan, and treaty ports
6. Can only release a puppet when it gets at least 75% of its cores on release
7. No nation ruining or exploits, like transfer cb to gain research points or release to reintegrate via event/decision
-- Any player nation willingly inherited by another player nation must be at less than 10 infamy
8. Rehosts on the hour.
-- Player war OOS/crash can be an exception
9. If you announce you cant make a session, your country is 'protected' i.e no nation ruining
-- Can't use this protection for consecutive weeks
-- Players who, before they leave: start wars, own or occupy contested land, leave the session early, or otherwise mess with players who are actually playing are only protected insofar that they can't have core and not-already-disputed territory taken, can't be nation-ruined, and can't be otherwise bullied.  (For instance, a France player who doesn't show up for 1860-1870 is can still have A-L taken from them, but no more).
10. Can repick a nation with GM approval (guideline is if current pick is ruined, irrelevant, or no longer exists)
11. RQs will be banned from playing important nations and will be banned from the server after repeat offenses
-- Can leave a campaign at anytime without being penalised in another campaign (unless above conditions apply)
-- Defense clause: if you think the GM is targeting you, contact an admin
12. Any player unanimously deemed toxic by his co-players for his actions in a game will be warned once and then banned
13. GM discretion on when rules are broken
14. Rules can be added/changed mid campaign/session if 2/3+ of the players and GM agree
