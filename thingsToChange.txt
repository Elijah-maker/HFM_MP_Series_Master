Changes that are waiting to be implemented:

* PDM ports:
-- Add in service economy, potentially more economy changes
-- add in some inventions
* Greater germany with all cores can expand east for infamy i.e to form the reichtangle
-- also when expanded can increase assimiltation for consiousness and slight militancy

* More states in China and India - change to UME map

* HPM take puppet CB
* CB to force enemy to cede all your cores from their puppets to you
* Decision for westernised indian state with nationalism to fight UK for control of india
* CB for absolute monarchies to justify on neighbouring republics to force them to become a monarchy (constitutional, like done to france)

Partially done:

greater germany doesnt get cores on croatia - need to actaully test this 

BUGS:

* Kiel canal decision doesnt work
* crashes in or after 1920
* when zapodslavia forms, poland shouldnt be annexed to the gp that forms it
